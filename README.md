This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#Ecommerce Website
This is built using CRA, Redux, and React-Bootstrap. This is meant as a template for creating an ecommerce website and in this first initial stage, has the ability to view items and add them to your cart managed by Redux.

##Future Work
Connect the applicaiton to a large API(Walmart) to allow users to search for products, view and filter items, and see detailed information for each item.
